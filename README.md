### Introduction

My main objective here is to study and demonstrate a Modern Data Stack working in practice.


</b>

### Getting Started

### Step 00

First, you need to create a code that retrieves data from a sample database and inserts it into MongoDB or you can use a sample dataset or dummy data to simulate the process (MongoDB offer a sample for you if you want). Once you have successfully implemented this step, we can move on to the next stages.

Confira abaixo, os passos para criar o seu ambiente local para acompanhar o workshop:

### Step 01 - MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and managing data. It diverges from traditional relational databases by using a document model, allowing for the storage of semi-structured and unstructured data.

### Step 02 - Airbyte

Airbyte is an open-source data integration platform designed to simplify and streamline the process of moving and syncing data between different sources and destinations. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing data pipelines, enabling organizations to build robust data infrastructure.

### Step 03 - Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform designed to handle large volumes of data and perform analytics at scale. It offers a fully managed and scalable solution for storing, processing, and analyzing data in the cloud.

### Step 04 - DBT

DBT is an open-source tool that stands for Data Build Tool. It is specifically designed for data analysts and engineers who work with SQL and want to build, test, and maintain data transformation pipelines efficiently. DBT helps you transform raw data into analytics-ready tables by applying a series of SQL-based transformations.

### Step 05 - Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It enables you to create and manage complex data pipelines by defining tasks and their dependencies as code.
